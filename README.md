# Image-processing-brainbow

# Brainbow is a neuroscience technique where individual neurones in the brain are genetically modified to express different combinatiions of fluorescent proteins
# Imaging with a fluorescent microscope gives a rainbow-like pattern
# Script decodes compressed pixel data from PNG 
# PNG filtering sytem reconstructs image rows 
# Code reads brainbow PNG, extracts pixel data, applies filters and saved modified images
# Isolates red, green and blue channels 
# Each neurones colour comes from their respective absorbance of fluorescent proteins
# By isolating specific colour channels, researchs can quantify where specifc proteins are expressed.
